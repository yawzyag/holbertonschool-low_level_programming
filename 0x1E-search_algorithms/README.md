Searching Algorithms are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored



## Sequential Search

In this, the list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked.

##  Interval Search
 
These algorithms are specifically designed for searching in sorted data-structures. These type of searching algorithms are much more efficient than Linear Search as they repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half
