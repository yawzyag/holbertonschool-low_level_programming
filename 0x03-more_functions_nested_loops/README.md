## how to use our own library in C
see [Making a Library](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/c15.htm)

> We can use our own libraries in C, for different functions, that contains our own code, every library consists of two parts: a header file and the actual code file. The header file, normally denoted by a .h suffix, contains information about the library that programs using it need to know. In general, the header file contains constants and types, along with prototypes for functions available in the library

----
## Functions
A function is a group of statements that together perform a task

----
## declaration and definition
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.

## Prototype
Function prototype declaration is necessary in order to provide information to the compiler about function, about return type, parameter list and function name etc
